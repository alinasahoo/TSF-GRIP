# The Sparks Foundation -Graduation Rotational Internship Program

This repository is dedicated to the completion of all my tasks from The Sparks Foundation (Graduate Rotational Internship Program).
As of now, I will be updating the tasks from my domain : Data Science and Business Analytics for the November 2020 batch.

## Technical : Task 1 - Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
### Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. 
This is supposed to be done with linear regression as we will be using just 2 variables. Data for this model can be found at : http://bit.ly/w-data. 

## Tools/IDE : Python/Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook

### What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?
We need to predict the score of the student if he/she studies for 9.25 hrs/day.
